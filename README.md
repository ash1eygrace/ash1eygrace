👋 Hi, I’m Ashley. 

👩🏻‍💻 I’m a Happiness Engineer at Automattic and provide escalated support for WordPress.com, Pressable.com, and Newspack.pub.

🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack JavaScript via [The Odin Project’s curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript?), and dabbling in React and Node.js along the way. 

🔭 I’m currently working on [AshAI](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/ai-content), a React App that uses OpenAI’s GTP-3 auto-regressive deep learning language model to generate human-like text.
