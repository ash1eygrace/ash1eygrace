👋 Hi, I’m Ashley. 

🌱 I'm learning full-stack JavaScript with a focus on TypeScript, React, and Node.js. 

👩🏻‍💻 I work at Automattic, where I assist Happiness Engineers in supporting users of WordPress.com plugin-enbabled sites.

🔭 I’m working on [AshAI](https://github.com/ash1eygrace/ai-content), a React App that uses OpenAI’s GTP-3 auto-regressive deep learning language model to generate human-like text and a retro-style pixel display app for my [TidByte](https://github.com/tidbyt/community/).

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a zombie and post-apocalyptic addict! Recommendations: [The Last of Us](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/the-last-of-us-part-i/), [Dying Light](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/239140/), [Far Cry 5](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/552520/), [Train to Busan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_to_Busan), [The Girl with All the Gifts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17235026-the-girl-with-all-the-gifts) and [Day by Day Armageddon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74821.Day_by_Day_Armageddon).
